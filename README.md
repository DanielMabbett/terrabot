## üåü Overview
Inspired by the [Atlantis](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis) project, Terrabot focuses on enhancing the review process in your GitOps workflow. While Atlantis provides a comprehensive suite of features, Terrabot specializes in delivering Terraform Plan insights directly into your Pull Requests, empowering reviewers with all the information they need at their fingertips.

## üöÄ Why Terrabot?
Unlike fully-fledged tools like Atlantis, Terrabot offers a lightweight, focused approach. It's designed to integrate seamlessly into your environment, especially beneficial for:

- **Security**: Operate within private networks. Terrabot runs on self-hosted agents behind firewalls, ensuring your infrastructure's security.
- **Simplicity**: Get started quickly. Terrabot's minimal setup means you spend less time configuring and more time delivering.
- **Visibility**: Improve your PR reviews. Terrabot brings the details of Terraform plans right into your pull requests, enhancing the review experience.
